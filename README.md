This app is very simple.
It is a dice rolling game that uses some cryptographic methods to generate a "Lucky Nunber"
which will be compared to a random number.  Lucky Number's that are lower are winners, higher, losers!

Your job
========

* Clean up the app code where you see necessary.
* Check the game logic for any potential mistakes.
* There aren't any tests, if you want to write some, feel free.  (Totally optional, only a few tests please)
* Plenty of functionality is missing, feel free to add a couple of things you feel are missing.
